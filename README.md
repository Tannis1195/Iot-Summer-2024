# Tutorial on how to build an automatic plant watering system
This project was planned and carried out by Jonathan Lanner√•s (jl225yi) in June 2024.

This project is based on Raspberry Pi pico WH which reads the current soil moisture of two different plants and pumps water from a reservoir when the soil gets too dry. In addition to this the measures: Room temperature, Sunlight, Room Humidity, and current water level in the reservoir and uploads it to an Adafruit.io dashboard through Wifi. The project is powered through a 4000mha power bank connected to a Solar rechargeable power bank with 1000mha, this means that the system all in all has access to 5000mha (give or take) and is continually recharged when the sun is out. 

This project took place over 3 weeks, during these three weeks I only sporadically worked on the project. But all in all, I estimate that an average person with a basic understanding of programming and electronics could complete the project in ~10 hours.

## Objective
Are you the type of person who most often forgets that plants need water? Turns out that I am, and sadly one too many cactuses has not lived to tell the tale. In plain text I'm horrible at ensuring that my green friends get the care and attention they deserve (And desperately need), therefore, it was more than time to automate myself out of the equation and give the plants a fair chance. This project has given me a lot of new insights into the realm of home automation, mostly observations about how much is still to learn, but I have also gained a fascination with the relative simplicity and cheapness of deploying small IoT projects for home improvements. Although it should be mentioned that I had hoped that this project would lead me down the rabbit hole of IoT security questions, this was however, sadly not the case for this project.
